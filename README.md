# ReadyUp API Examples

_The ReadyUp API allows you to programmatically automate, manage, and distribute your gaming and esports events across all your owned and operated channels, communities and partners_


This repository provides a collection of examples of how to interact with the ReadyUp API.

Currently there are only examples for Python - which you can find the `python` folder.
